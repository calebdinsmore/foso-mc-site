To simplify trade/make it easier to trade, the server has implemented a currency backed by diamonds. The currency symbol is ♢ (so something valued at ♢200 means it's worth 200 diamonds).

# Commands

## /sell

```
/sell <<itemname>|<id>|hand|inventory|blocks> [-][amount]
```

To deposit your diamonds into your digital server wallet, use the `/sell` command.

Sellable items:

- Diamond (1♢/ea)
- Diamond Block (♢9/ea)

Examples:

- `/sell inventory`: Sell entire inventory of diamonds and diamond blocks.
- `/sell hand`: Sell the diamonds/diamond blocks in your hand
- `/sell inventory 10`: Sell 10 of the diamonds in your inventory

Once run, those commands will remove diamonds from your inventory and deposit ♢ into your account.

## /balance

Check your balance.

## /pay

```
/pay <player> <amount>
```

Pay another player an amount of ♢.

# Trading Currency Back for Diamonds

When you want to withdraw your ♢ and get your diamonds back, you'll need to visit the server's Central Bank, located near spawn (warp there with `/warp bank`).

There you will be able to interact with signs that give you diamonds in exchange for ♢ (1:1 exchange, just as with the `/sell` command).
