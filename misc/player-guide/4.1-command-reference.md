Here's a quick rundown of the various tools you have at your disposal.

# CoreProtect

The most important tool you have access to, CoreProtect ensures that incidents of griefing can be dealt with without having to revert to a previous snapshot of the entire server. This can also be used to undo accidental damage/mob damage.

[Here's a link to the documentation](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/)

## Essential Commands

### /co inspect

Enter inspection mode to inspect what changes have been made to blocks (right click to inspect) for the purpose of investigating griefing.

### /co rollback

Rollback block data.

**IMPORTANT:** before using this powerful command, reference the [command documentation](https://www.minerealm.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=6781). There are ways to undo this action (see below), but it's best to do it right the first time.
{:.error}

### /co undo

Undo a rollback/restore.

### /co restore

Restore block data.

# Staff+

Fortunately, we don't really have an issue with cheaters or badly behaving players on this server, so this toolkit feels pretty unnecessary.
