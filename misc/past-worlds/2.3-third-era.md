# A Map of the World

Here's a render of this world's map, centered at the cluster of islands at spawn:

I'm currently working on getting map markers done and on the site. Know any special locations that need markers? [Help fill out the Google Sheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAggYLvvha_OhNTVlDR_fCrqyZHodOzIWFpYbEXNdM0/edit#gid=0)

# A Brief History

This era's world was much more oceanic, which was appropriate given that 1.13 was Minecraft's "Aquatic" update.

Because it felt a bit sad to say goodbye to the Old World, special physical warp locations were created that allowed players to jump from the New World back to the Old World at will. To get to the Old World from the New, players had to swim to the bottom of a frozen pond atop one of the spawn island's peaks. To return, you leapt from the server shop into a one-block wide hole, falling through the world until you warped hundreds of blocks above the New World's spawn island, landing safely in a pool of water.

I was much more hands off with this iteration of the server, so I especially welcome any contributions anyone wants to make to this page!
