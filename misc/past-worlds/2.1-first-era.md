# A Brief History

Started during the January term ("J-term") of 2015, this was initially a pure vanilla 1.8 server. It ran on my MacBook Pro during specific uptime windows, since I didn't want to keep it running 24/7.

Initially there were issues hosting it on the campus network because of how the network was configured, so for a time the server was connected to a separate wireless router I bought off Amazon solely so I could operate a separate wireless LAN without bumping into the campus network restrictions.

Not much is remembered about this era except that I, as a young admin, was prone to excessive trolling of my players. This trolling effectively ceased after an incident where I summoned every mob in 50 block radius to Andy, who I hadn't realized was at his house at the time--a house which thereafter did not exist due to too many creepers.

Unfortunately, little has survived from this era. Fortunately, much has survived of the eras following it.
