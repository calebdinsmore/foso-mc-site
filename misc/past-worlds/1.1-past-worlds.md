The FOSO Minecraft server has a decent amount of history. Nearly 7 years of effort by FOSOans and FOSO-adjacent friends and Gerig alums have gone into it, both in its current form and in past worlds.

Here's my effort to document all of that in some small way, including links to zipped downloads of all world files (that I still have, RIP First Era).

By the way, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions people want to make to this record. I don't have the time or even complete knowledge about the places and events within each era of the server to make a complete historical record, so I welcome any and all help or information!
