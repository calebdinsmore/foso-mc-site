# A Map of the World

You might be wondering how I got the isometric image at this page's header. Well, one of the things I've been working on is getting Mapcrafter renders of the old worlds generated and hosted online as a fun way to explore the old maps without having to open them up in Minecraft.

Here's a link to the render from this era, centered at spawn:

<div style="position: relative;overflow: hidden;padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;border: 0;" src="https://second-era.minecraft.fosoterritory.com/#map_myworld/0/11/-113/-94/64" title="Second Era Map" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

I'm currently working on getting map markers done and on the site. Know any special locations that need markers? [Help fill out the Google Sheet!](https://www.mediafire.com/file/uhln7qexw0mehae/2015-2018_SecondEra.zip/file)

# A Brief History

This era represented a major transition for the server from an ad hoc server running on a laptop to a mainstay of our small community. For the first time, the server ran 24/7, and other members of Gerig joined in the fun.

Over the course of its 3-year lifespan, this era had been run on

- a laptop,
- a small Raspberry Pi-like computer (except much more powerful),
- a rented remote server in Dallas,
- one of the university's retired servers,
- and finally on an HP server, which is where it's running today.

Fifty players in total over the course of three years participated in the era that cemented this server as a more permanent fixture and not just a fun diversion for the school year.

# An Era of Power

This era also saw me having some fun writing a plugin that granted various specific players different abilities and weaknesses according to specific themes the players created. For instance, the first player I wrote powers for was SkeletonKing717, who chose to model his strengths and weaknesses after skeletons.

## The Skeleton King (SkeletonKing717)

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When health goes below half, is immediately teleported home and "wimps out" |

# Key landmarks

## The Spine, Backbone of the Economy

The Spine was a large railroad infrastructure project spearheaded by SkeletonKing717 that connected a number of player homes via a network of underground mine cart rails.

## The Server Shop

Built early in this era's lifetime, the server shop was home to a number of server shop stalls that sold various materials as well as specially designed enchanted items--most famous among them the "Pickaxe of Supreme Wreckage."

The server shop also housed the Hunger Games lobby, where players could start Hunger Games matches in any of the different maps connected to the server.

# The End of an Era

After three years of continuous operation, the decision was made to reset the server world for a second time after 1.13 released--a release that changed so much about Minecraft's internals that it really wasn't feasible to try to use a 1.12 world in a 1.13 environment.
