Welcome to the new FOSO Minecraft server knowledge base/docs site! This inaugural post gives a quick overview of the site and goes over some recent big changes.

<!--more-->

# New Website

Welcome to the new FOSO MC website! I created this so that there would be a single place to house change logs, how-tos, and whatever else I feel like putting on here.

# New Digs

As of Friday, July 16th, the server has a new home! On Thursday I built a new machine to run the server--one that is substantially more powerful in basically every way compared to the machines that came before it. Chunk loading should be way snappier, and it should be able to handle the hordes of entities people cram into their farms (though, please still be reasonable about how many you're cramming into your farms).

The new hardware should open up more possibilities with the server (Hunger Games, anyone?).

# Player Guide

There's not that much to see yet, but I recommend taking a look at the [player guide](/misc/player-guide/player-guide). Along with information about the plugins and datapacks most relevant to players, it also has some information on some of the economy enhancements that are being added to the server at this moment, like how to make shops and trade diamonds for currency. It'll be updated as new plugins/features are added the the server that players care about.

# Previous World Downloads

It's been a long time coming, but downloads of the previous server files are here! The link to download each past world is at the top of that world's dedicated page, which should be easy to find. There are some other cool things on those pages, so definitely check them out!

Check out the past worlds' history pages [here](/misc/past-worlds/past-worlds)!

# Economy Changes

Lastly, I've added economy features to the server! You can now exchange diamonds for the server's diamond-based currency (♢). ! diamond = ♢1, which can be used in player-built shops or exchanged back for actual diamonds via the server bank (`/warp bank`).

More info on currency and shops can be found in [the relevant pages of the player guide](/misc/player-guide/server-currency).

Thanks again for playing and making the server a great place!
